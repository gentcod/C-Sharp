# Simple-Console-Calculator
## Learning C#

This is a simple console application built by adopting Object Oriented Programming and Pipeling concepts. It is quite simple to understand and easy to navigate.

## Scripts guide:

To get the necessary dependencies, run:

`dotnet retore`
##

To run the application, navigate into the /Calculator directory and then you can run:

`dotnet run`
##

To run a unit test on the methods used for calculation, you can run:

`dotnet test`
##

To contribute, you can help creating other mathematical methods to make it more robust ðŸ˜Š. Do remember to create a unit test method in the /Calculator.Test directory, to compare expected result and derived result ðŸ˜‰. 
I'm open to suggestions on how abstraction can be achieved for the mathematical methods. PS: I tried using some access modifiers but that caused some issues with the methods used for unit testing.
